Clinical Pharmacology Protocol Synopsis: Study I7T-MC-RMAA
  Name of Investigational Product: LY2623091
Title of Study: Disposition of [14C]-LY2623091 following Oral Administration in Healthy Subjects
Number of Planned Subjects: Up to 8 subjects toPhase of Development: 1
 ensure that 4 subjects complete
Length of Study: Approximately 30 days (from Check-in through Follow-up visit)
         Objectives:
      Primary Objective:
To determine the disposition of radioactivity and LY2623091 in healthy subjects following oral
administration of a single dose of 25 mg (100 uCi) [14C]-LY2623091.
     Secondary Objectives:
To determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) of total radioactivity in plasma and whole blood, and
LY2623091 in plasma following oral administration of a single dose of 25 mg (100 uCi)
              [14C]-LY2623091.
To assess the mass balance of LY2623091 by quantifying radioactivity excretion in urine, feces, and
       expired air (if applicable).
To identify the major metabolites of LY2623091 in plasma, urine, and feces (if applicable).
To assess the safety and tolerability of a single dose of LY2623091 in healthy subjects.
Study Design: An open-label study in which up to 8 healthy male subjects will receive a single dose of 25 mg
LY2623091 containing approximately 100 uCi [14C]-LY2623091.
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: Overtly healthy (as determined by medical history physical
examination, clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiogram [ECG]) males aged 18 to 65 years, inclusive, with a
body mass index of 18.5 to 32.0 kg/m2, inclusive.
Test Product, Dosage, and Mode of Administration: Single oral dose of 25 mg LY2623091 free base in
solution containing approximately 100 uCi [14C]-LY2623091
Planned Duration of Treatment: A single oral dose of [14C]-LY2623091 will be administered on Day 1.
Subjects will be confined to the clinical research unit for a minimum of 14 days postdose (Day 15) to a maximum
  of 21 days postdose (Day 22).
    Criteria for Evaluation:
Safety: Safety parameters will include adverse event assessments, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital sign
measurements, 12-lead ECGs, body weight, and physica examinations.
Bioanalytical: Concentrations of LY2623091 in plasma will be assayed using a validated bioanalytical method.
Concentrations of radioactivity in whole blood, plasma, urine, feces, and expired air (if applicable) will be
assessed by liquid scintillation counting of radioactivity. Quantitation of metabolites may also be considered, if
deemed appropriate. Metabolite identification in urine, feces, and plasma will be determined using appropriate
        techniques.
Pharmacokinetic: The primary PK parameters wil include: maximum observed drug concentration (Cmax), time
           ofCmax (tmax), area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) from time zero to time t, where t is the last
time point with a measurable concentration (AUC[O-tlast]), AUC from zero to infinity (AUC[O-0]), and half-life
associated with the terminal rate constant (Az) in noncompartmental analysis (t1/2). Other noncompartmental
parameters, such as apparent total body clearance of drug calculated after extra-vascular administration (CL/F) and
apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase after extra-vascular administration (Vz/F), may be
reported. The blood cell/plasma distribution will be calculated for radiolabeled material. The percentage of
radiolabeled dose excreted in feces and urine will be calculated. The percentage of radiolabeled dose excreted in
expired air will also be calculated, if applicable.

                                            5. Introduction
               5.1. General Introduction
LY2623091 is a selective, orally active, nonsteroidal, competitive mineralocorticoid receptor
antagonist (MRA) currently being developed for the treatment of patients with hypertension.
Excessive aldosterone production and increased mineralocorticoid receptor activity have been
hypothesized to play a role in the disease pathogenesis of patients with uncontrolled blood
pressure while on multiple antihypertensive drugs (Shibata and Itoh 2012). Aldosterone
inhibition with patients that have difficult to control blood pressure may be successful, but
current agents that inhibit aldosterone have the side effects of gynecomastia and hyperkalemia.
This highlights the need for a new MRA with an improved efficacy and safety profile.
LY2623091 may be a safer, better tolerated, and more efficacious alternative.
LY2623091 has been evaluated in 2 clinical pharmacology studies (single ascending and
multiple ascending dose studies) and 1 multiple dose therapeutic study in patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD). LY2623091 was generally safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects at
single doses up to 450 mg or after 7 days of daily dosing up to 25 mg and in CKD patients after
21 days of daily dosing up to 10 mg. At the highest single dose of 450 mg -Y2623091
administered in clinical studies, mild and transient serum potassium elevations above the upper
limit of normal were observed; no other consistent increases in serum potassium were seen for
any other group. After 7 days of daily dosing to healthy subjects, there were transient
asymptomatic increases in serum potassium levels after an oral potassium challenge; effects
   consistent with the expected pharmacology of LY2623091.
After single oral dosing in healthy subjects in the fed state at doses ranging from 5 to 450 mg,
median peak LY2623091 plasma concentrations (as represented by time of maximum observed
drug concentrations [tmax]) were 3 to 4 hours postdose. After reaching the maximum observed
drug concentration (Cmax), the plasma LY2623091 concentration exhibited a biphasic decline,
with a shallow distribution phase, and a median terminal phase half-life (t1/2) of 47.3 to
52.3 hours. Both LY2623091 exposure (as represented by area under the concentration versus
time curve [AUC] from zero to infinity [AUCo-o]) and Cmax generally increased in proportion to
           dose.
A 5-mg/kg dose of [14C]-LY2623091 was administered orally to male and female rats or male
dogs, with blood and plasma collected at various time points up to 120 to 144 hours postdose and
excreta collected for up to 10 days. Tissue distribution was determined in male Long Evans rats
for radiation dosimetry calculations. The mean terminal elimination half-life of LY2623091 in
plasma was 2 to 4 hours after oral administration in rats and approximately 16 hours in dogs with
both species showing a longer half-life of elimination for radioactivity from plasma ranging from
27 to 32.5 hours. The mean total recovery of radioactivity was >95% in rat and approximately
         LY2623091

90% in dog. In rats and dogs, the major route of elimination of radioactivity was in feces (and
bile in rats) with negligible elimination in urine. Preliminary metabolite identification data
suggests that [14C]-LY2623091 was well absorbed and eliminated primarily as metabolites. In
rats, the major metabolic clearance pathway observed was the N,O-dealkylation C2H2) from
the morpholine ring which accounted for a large portion of the dose (>33%). In dogs, there were
two primary routes of metabolic clearance, the N,O-dealkylation observed in rats and oxidative
deamination with a loss of the morpholine. The oxidative deamination was a major metabolic
       clearance pathway in dogs.
More information about the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably anticipated
adverse events (AEs) may be found in the Investigator's Brochure (IB). Information on AEs
expected to be related to the investigational product may be found in Section 7 (Development
Core Safety Information) of the IB. Information on serious adverse events (SAEs) expected in
the study population independent of drug exposure and that will be assessed by the sponsor in
aggregate periodically during the course of the study, may be found in Section 6 (Effects in
         Humans) of the IB.
                5.2. Rationale and Justification for the Study
This study is being conducted to determine the routes of elimination and extent of metabolism of
LY2623091, including identification of metabolites in plasma, urine, and feces in healthy male
subjects after a single oral administration of LY2623091 containing [14C]-LY2623091. The
total administered dose will be 25 mg, which is supported by the available safety data from
3 completed clinical studies. A Phase 2 dose ranging study evaluating multiple daily doses of up
to 24.5 mg LY2623091 in hypertensive patients is planned. The radiotracer will be administered
at approximately 100 uCi to each subject to facilitate characterization of the physiologic
      disposition and metabolism of LY2623091.
Findings from previous nonclinical and clinical studies indicate a relatively long half-life of
LY2623091 and metabolite(s); therefore, the duration of clinical confinement will be a minimum
   of 14 days postdose up to 21 days postdose.
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-LY2623091 to male pigmented and nonpigmented rats,
radioactivity was widely distributed in tissues and organs (Press and Shefchek 2014). In
pigmented male rats, most tissues had peak radioactivity concentrations at 2 or 4 hours postdose.
The tissues showing the highest peak concentrations were liver, uveal tract, adrenal gland,
pituitary gland, renal cortex, and kidney. Radioactivity concentrations in central nervous system
tissues protected by the blood:brain barrier (cerebellum, cerebrum, medulla, olfactory lobe, and
spinal cord) were low, and were not detectable by 120 hours postdose. [14C]-
LY2623091-related radioactivity was selectively associated with melanin-containing uveal tract
tissues but not in skin or meninges. Distribution trends in the nonpigmented rats were generally
  comparable with those seen in pigmented male rats.
Therefore, the administration of a single 100-uCi oral dose of [14C]-LY2623091 would not be
expected to represent a significant radiation exposure risk to healthy human subjects.

               6.1. Primary Objective
The primary objective is to determine the disposition of radioactivity and LY2623091 in healthy
subjects following oral administration of a single dose of 25 mg (100 uCi) [14C]-LY2623091
                 6.2. Secondary Objectives
      The secondary objectives are:

               (100 uCi) [14C]-LY2623091.
To assess the mass balance of LY2623091 by quantifying radioactivity excretion in urine,
       feces, and expired air (if applicable).
  To identify the major metabolites of LY2623091 in plasma, urine, and feces (if
               applicable).

                  7.1. Summarv of Study Design
This is an open-label, single-center study performed in healthy male subjects who will receive a
single oral dose of 25 mg LY2623091 containing [14C]-LY2623091 (approximately 100 uCi).
The compound will be administered as an oral solution. Up to 8 subjects will be enrolled. It is
planned that up to 6 subjects will be dosed initially and 2 additional subjects will be dosed if
needed (as determined by appropriate Lilly representatives) in order that a minimum of
     4 subjects complete the study.
Subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on the day before dosing (Day -1).
It is planned that subjects will remain at the CRU for a minimum of 14 days postdose (Day 15)
to a maximum of 21 days postdose (Day 22), during which samples will be collected for the
determination of whole blood and plasma radioactivity and plasma concentrations of LY2623091
and metabolites, if applicable. Subjects may be discharged from the CRU on or after Day 15
after at least 90% of the administered radioactivity (based on the actual dose) has been recovered
or 24-hour urine and fecal samples from 2 consecutive collections have radioactivity levels less
than 1.0% of the total administered radioactivity in urine and feces combined.
Sequential urine and fecal samples will be obtained to determine the mass balance of
[14C]-LY2623091 and to identify metabolites. Samples of expired air will be collected for the
analysis of 14CO2 at selected time points. If a significant amount of administered radioactivity is
present in expired air samples, these data will be included in the calculation of radioactivity dose
recovery. The fraction of the dose eliminated in excreta will be estimated by measuring the
amount of radioactivity in the urine and/or feces for each collection period. Radioactivity in all
samples will be measured by liquid scintillation counting (LSC), either directly (in urine, plasma,
and expired air) or after combustion in an oxidizer apparatus (in feces and whole blood).
Sequential blood samples will be obtained after dose administration to quantify the PK of
LY2623091. Separate blood samples will also be taken at selected time points for metabolite
         profiling.
Safety will be explored by clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, 12-lead
electrocardiograms (ECGs), body weight, physical examinations, and recording of AEs.
A follow-up assessment, which will be conducted by telephone, will be performed approximately
7 days after each subject has been discharged from the CRU or after early discontinuation from
         the study.
The study schedule of events is presented in Attachment 1.

                 7.2. Discussion of Design and Control
This study has an open-label design with no control treatment. This type of design is standard
and widely used in radiolabeled studies. Oral administration has been chosen as this is the
intended clinical route of LY2623091 administration. The duration of the study is based on
clinical PK data (t1/2 for LY2623091 is between 47.3 and 52.3 hours). Based upon the available
clinical and preclinical PK of LY2623091, the duration of this study is considered adequate to
     achieve the study objectives.

               8.2. Discontinuation
The reason for and date of discontinuation will be collected for all subjects. All enrolled subjects
who discontinue, regardless of whether or not they received investigational product, will have
procedures performed as shown in the Study Schedule (Attachment 1).
               8.2.1. Discontinuation of Subjects
         8.2.1.1. Subjects Inadvertently Enrolled
The criteria for enrollment must be followed explicitly. If the investigator site identifies a
subject who did not meet enrollment criteria and who was inadvertently enrolled, the sponsor
must be notified. If the sponsor identifies a subject who did not meet enrollment criteria and
who was inadvertently enrolled, the investigator site will be notified. A discussion must occur
between the Lilly clinical pharmacologist (CP) or clinical research physician (CRP) and the
investigator to determine whether the subject may continue in the study without investigational
product. Inadvertently enrolled subjects may be maintained in the study when the investigator
and Lilly CP or CRP agree it is medically appropriate for that subject. The subject may not
continue in the study without investigational product if the Lilly CP or CRP does not agree with
the investigator's determination it is medically appropriate for the subject to continue. The
investigator must obtain documented approval from Lilly CP or CRP to allow the inadvertently
enrolled subject to continue in the study without investigational product.
        8.2.1.2. Discontinuations from Investigational Product or from the Study
Subjects will be discontinued from the study in the following circumstances:
Enrollment in any other clinical trial involving an investigationa product or enrollment in
any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible
              with this study.
              Investigator Decision
      the investigator decides that the subject should be discontinued from the study
               Subject Decision
            the subject requests to be discontinued from the study
                Sponsor Decision
  Lilly stops the study or stops the subject's participation in the study for medical,
    safety, regulatory, or other reasons consistent with applicable laws, regulations,
                 and good clinical practice (GCP)
                Adverse Event
      if a clinically significant event (CSE) occurs, appropriate measures should be
         taken. Lilly or its designee should be alerted immediately. A CSE will be
      defined as a moderate to severe AE, abnorma clinical sign, or clinical laboratory
         LY2623091
             I7T-MC-RMAA Protocol                                                Page 21
      finding that may pose a risk to the wellbeing of the subject. Refer to Safety
                    Evaluations Section.
      a clinically significant systemic hypersensitivity reaction occurs following
        administration of the investigationa product (for example, drug-related
           symptomatic bronchospasm, allergy-related edemalangioedema, or hypotension),
       that requires parenteral medication, does not respond to symptomatic medication,
        or results in clinical sequelae or an anaphylactic reaction.
Following the investigator's determination that CSE criteria have been met and the investigator's
judgment of relatedness to the investigational product is documented, a decision will be made
between the investigator and Lilly or its designee regarding subject discontinuation.
The nature of any conditions clinical signs or symptoms, or abnormal laboratory values present
at the time of discontinuation and any applicable follow-up procedures will be documented.
Discontinuation procedures are outlined in the Study Schedule (Attachment 1).
          8.2.1.3. Subjects Lost to Follow-up
A subject will be considered lost to follow-up if he is unable to be contacted by the study site.
Site personne are expected to make diligent attempts to contact subjects who fail to return for a
scheduled visit or were otherwise unable to be followed up by the site.
               8.2.2. Discontinuation of Study Sites
Study site participation may be discontinued if Lilly, the investigator, or the IRB of the study site
judges it necessary for any reason consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and GCP.
               8.2.3. Discontinuation of the Study
The study will be discontinued, if no subjects have been dosed with [14C]-LY2623091 if Lilly
judges it necessary for medical, safety, regulatory, or other reasons consistent with applicable
       laws, regulations, and GCP.

                 9.1. Treatment Materials and Supplies
The study drug will consist of unlabeled and radiolabeled _Y2623091 to provide 25 mg of total
active pharmaceutical ingredient with approximately 100 uCi of radioactivity in each unit dose
container. An appropriate amount of vehicle will be added to the powder in the container and
appropriately mixed before administration (as described in detail in a separate Pharmacy Manual,
or equivalent document). The container will be rinsed twice with an appropriate vehicle; each
time the subject will ingest the rinse. The dose will be prepared on the morning of dosing. The
      study drug regimen is shown in Table RMAA.1.
           Table RMAA.1.      Study Drug Regimen
         Product:       LY2623091 and [14C]-LY2623091
           Dose:      25 mg (approximately 100 uCi)
                   (supplied as "powder-in-a-bottle")
        Formulation:       Solution
                9.2. Treatment Administration
 The investigator or designee is responsible for:
explaining the correct use of the investigational agent to the site personnel,
      verifying that instructions are followed properly,
maintaining accurate records of investigational product dispensing and collection,
and returning all unused medication to Lilly or its designee at the end of the study.
Subjects will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he has a complaint or
problem with the investigational product so that the situation can be assessed.
All clinical trial material provided to the investigator will be stored in a secure place, and
allocated and dispensed by appropriately trained persons. The allocation and dispensing of the
investigational products will be fully documented and verified by a second person. Detailed
records of the amounts of the investigational product received, dispensed and remaining at the
    end of the study will be maintained.
Dosing will be carried out by appropriately qualified CRU staff designated by the investigator.
In addition, these designated personnel must be qualified to handle and dispense
        radiopharmaceuticals.
On the morning of Day 1, designated personnel (e.g., registered Nuclear pharmacist) will add the
vehicle (aqueous ethanol followed by degassed Sprite) to the unit dose container with study
drug and the contents will be mixed until all of the solid has dispersed (as described in detail in a
separate Pharmacy Manual, or equivalent document). Each container will be marked with an
identifier corresponding to the subject who will receive the dose from that container, including
 the approximate amount of radioactivity in each dose.

The last meal on the day before dosing will be given no later than 2200 hours, although water
will be allowed. After an overnight fast of at least 10 hours, the study drug solution
(approximately 50 mL) will be administered to the subjects. The containers will be rinsed twice
(approximately 50 mL each) by designated personnel using degassed Spritee. After the
formulation and rinses are administered, 90 mL of room temperature water will be given to the
subjects, so that a total of approximately 240 mL of liquid (150-mL vehicle/rinses plus 90 mL of
room temperature water) will have been consumed by each subject as part of their dosing. Each
subject will stand or sit while taking this dose and will not recline for at least 2 hours afterwards,
except as necessary for sample collections and vital sign measurements. Each dosing vessel will
be retained for analysis of residual radioactivity. Unused containers with study drug that were
not reconstituted shall be kept secure until discarded in accordance with institution radiation
guidelines. Fluids will be restricted from 1 hour prior to and until 1 hour after dosing with the
exception of fluid included in the dosing mixture and rinses. Otherwise, water will be freely
     available at all times.
                9.3. Rationale for Selection of Dose
The dose of 25 mg (100 uCi) LY2623091 is considered to be in the therapeutic dose range for
the treatment of hypertension and is high enough to fully characterize the single oral dose PK of
the compound. The use of 100 uCi was chosen because it is an industry standard and will
provide sufficient radiation to determine the metabolite profile.
                 9.4. Specific Restrictions/Requirements
Prior to beginning the study, the subjects will complete screening procedures including informed
consent, review of medical history, 12-lead ECG, vital signs, drug screen, height, weight, BMI,
    and clinical laboratory tests.
Throughout the study, subjects may undergo medical assessments and review of compliance with
 restrictions before continuing in the study.
Meals/Diet On the day of [14C]-LY2623091 administration (Day 1), the subjects will be fasted
for at least 10 hours prior to dosing. Food will be restricted until at least 4 hours after dosing, at
which time subjects will be given a high-fiber meal. Fluids will be restricted from 1 hour prior
to and until 1 hour after dosing with the exception of fluid included in the dosing mixture and
rinses. Otherwise, water will be freely available at all times. Meals will be provided as
    appropriate at all other times.
A high-fiber diet will be served throughout the study in order to promote gastrointestinal transit.
Subjects will refrain from consuming grapefruit, grapefruit juice, grapefruit-containing products,
Seville oranges or Seville orange juice, and star fruit or star fruit juice from 7 days prior to
  dosing until the last specimen collection.
Subjects will refrain from consuming xanthine-containing food and drink from 48 hours prior to
     admission until discharge from the CRU.

Alcohol Subjects will not consume alcohol for 48 hours prior to admission and while resident
in the CRU. Subjects that have an average weekly alcohol intake that exceeds 21 units (1 unit
12 OZ or 360 mL of beer; 5 OZ or 150 mL of wine; 1.5 OZ or 45 mL of distilled spirits) per week
(males up to age 65), or are unwilling to stop alcohol consumption from 48 hours prior to
check-in until end of study will not be enrolled into the study.
Smoking Smoking will not be permitted throughout the study. Subjects will not have used any
tobacco- or nicotine-containing products (including, but not limited to, cigarettes, pipes, cigars,
chewing tobacco, nicotine patches, nicotine lozenges, or nicotine gum) within 6 months prior to
    dosing and during the entire study.
Exercise No strenuous exercise will be allowed for 72 hours prior to dosing and during the
          study.
Contraception Males will be sterile (including vasectomy) or if the subject is not sterile and is
sexually active, he will agree to use from Check-in until 3 months after study exit/discharge, 1 of
the following approved double barrier methods of contraception: a male condom with
spermicide, a sterile sexual partner and use of spermicide, use by female sexual partner of an
intrauterine device with spermicide, a female condom with spermicide, contraceptive sponge
with spermicide, a diaphragm with spermicide, a cervical cap with spermicide; or oral,
implantable, transdermal, intravaginal, or injectable contraceptives and use of spermicide.
              9.5. Blinding
     This is an open-label study.
                 9.6. Concomitant Therapy
Acetaminophen or ibuprofen may be used at the discretion of the investigator. A low-fiber stool
softener (for example, ColaceTM) may be administered as needed for daily bowel movements.
Additional concomitant medications are prohibited during the study unless required to treat an
            AE.
           Ifthe need for concomitant medication arises, inclusion or continuation of the subject may be at
the discretion of the investigator after consultation with a Lilly clinical pharmacologist or clinical
research physician Any additional medication used during the course of the study must be
           documented.

Attachment 1 lists the schedule for sample collections in this study.
Attachment 2 lists the clinical laboratory tests that will be performed for this study.
Attachment 3 summarizes the blood volumes for all blood sampling during the study.
                10.1. Laboratory Samples
Blood and urine samples will be collected to determine whether subjects meet
inclusion/exclusion criteria and to monitor subject health. Routine clinical laboratory tests will
    be analyzed by a local laboratory.
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safety report.
Samples collected for specified laboratory tests will be destroyed within 60 days of receipt of
confirmed test results. Tests are run and confirmed promptly whenever scientifically
appropriate. When scientific circumstances warrant, however, it is acceptable to retain samples
to batch the tests run, or to retain the samples until the end of the study to confirm that the results
are valid. Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply with
applicable laws, regulations, or laboratory certification standards.
                      10.2. Samples for Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic
                    Evaluations
                10.2.1. Pharmacokinetic Samples
            10.2.1.1. Whole Blood and Plasma Samples
At the time points specified in the Study Schedule, venous blood samples of approximately
10 mL each will be collected for PK analysis and radioanalysis (Attachment 1). Whole blood
and plasma samples will be used to determine the plasma concentrations of LY2623091 and
metabolites (as deemed appropriate). Additional venous blood samples (approximately 15 mL
each) will be drawn for metabolite profiling at the times specified in the Study Schedule
(Attachment 1). The actual date and time of each sampling will be recorded. Instructions for the
collection and handling of blood samples will be provided by the sponsor.
           10.2.1.2. Urine and Feces Samples
Feces (if possible) and urine will be collected before study drug administration. After dosing
with study drug, cumulative feces and urine samples will be collected as described below in
specified containers according to the Study Schedule (Attachment 1) until the specified release
       criteria have been met.
Urine will be collected for the characterization of renal clearance at the specified intervals into
1 or more containers (depending on volume excreted). An aliquot of each collection interval will
be analyzed to yield the percentage of radioactivity excreted within that interval.

Feces from each bowel movement will be collected and the time of collection will be noted. For
each subject, feces samples will be combined by the analytical laboratory for each 24-hour
period and subsequently analyzed to determine the percentage of radioactivity excreted over that
period. Toilet paper used after a bowel movement will be collected into a separate container
from feces and analyzed for radioactivity if deemed appropriate. The inability to produce a fecal
 sample will not be considered a protocol deviation.
         10.2.1.3. Expired Air and Other Biological Samples
A sample of expired air wil be collected for analysis of 14CO2 prior to dosing (negative control
sample) and at the times indicated in the Study Schedule (Attachment 1). If a significant amount
of the radioactivity is present in expired air samples, the raw data will be extrapolated to provide
an estimate of the percentage of the dose eliminated via 14CO2. Additional expired air samples
may be collected at some or all of the times that blood samples are drawn and only analyzed if
           needed.
Other biological fluids, such as vomit, may be collected, if deemed appropriate, to obtain
      complete recovery of the dose.
             10.2.2. Bioanalysis
Samples will be analyzed at a laboratory approved by the sponsor and stored at a facility
       designated by the sponsor.
Whole blood, plasma, urine, expired air (if applicable), and fecal concentrations of radioactivity
will be determined using LSC techniques. Blood and feces will be combusted prior to LSC.
Plasma concentrations of LY2623091 will be determined using a validated liquid
chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection method at a laboratory approved by
the sponsor. The quantitation of metabolites may also be considered, if deemed appropriate.
Metabolite identification in urine, feces, and plasma will be determined using appropriate
techniques such as liquid chromatography/radiodetection and liquid chromatography/mass
          spectrometry.
Bioanalytical samples collected during radiolabeled studies will be retained for a maximum of
2 years following last subject visit for the study. During this time, sample remaining after the
bioanalyses may be used for exploratory analyses such as additional metabolism and/or protein
          binding work.
                  10.2.3. Pharmacodynamic Evaluations
         Not applicable.
                  10.3. Samples for Biomarker Research
There is growing evidence that genetic variation may impact a patient's response to therapy.
Variable response to therapy may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption,
distribution, metabolism, and excretion, the mechanism of action of the drug, the disease
         LY2623091
             I7T-MC-RMAA Protocol                                                Page 27
etiology and/or the molecular subtype of the disease being treated. Therefore, where local
regulations and IRBs allow, a blood sample will be collected for pharmacogenetic (PGx) analysis
     as noted in the Study Schedule.
In the event of an unexpected AE or the observation of unusual response, the pharmacogenetic
samples may be genotyped and analysis may be performed to evaluate a genetic association with
response to LY2623091. These investigations may be limited to a focused candidate gene study
or, if appropriate, genome wide analysis may be performed to identify regions of the genome
associated with the variability observed in drug response. The pharmacogenetic samples will
only be used for investigations related to disease and drug or class of drugs under study in the
context of this clinical program. They will not be used for broad exploratory unspecified disease
     or population genetic analysis.
The samples will be coded with the subject number and stored for up to a maximum 15 years
after the last subject visit for the study at a facility selected by the sponsor. The samples and any
data generated from them can only be linked back to the subject by investigator site personnel.
The duration allows the sponsor to respond to regulatory requests related to the investigational
          product.
Pharmacogenetic sampling will be a mandatory onetime sample that should be taken prior to
         dosing on Day 1.
              10.4. Safetv Evaluations
Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects who have entered this study
and for alerting Lilly or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be
considered an unanticipated benefit to the subject.
The investigator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of subjects during the study.
Planned safety assessments and measures are detailed in Section 10.4.3, but additional
assessments and safety tests may be performed at the investigator's discretion.
The investigator remains responsible for following, through an appropriate health care option,
AEs that are serious, considered related to study treatment or the study, or that caused the subject
to discontinue before completing the study. The subject should be followed until the event is
resolved or explained. Frequency of follow-up evaluation is left to the discretion of the
        investigator.
In addition to records of observations made at specific times, unexpected signs and symptoms
and concomitant medications will be recorded in the clinical trial records throughout the study.
              10.4.1. Adverse Events
Lilly has standards for reporting AEs that are to be followed regardless of applicable regulatory
   requirements that may be less stringent.
         LY2623091
             I7T-MC-RMAA Protocol                                                Page 28
Study site personnel will record the occurrence and nature of each subject's preexisting
conditions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in
         the study.
After the ICF is signed, site personnel will record any change in the condition(s) and the
occurrence and nature of any AEs. All AEs related to protocol procedures are reported to Lilly
         or designee.
Any clinically significant findings from ECGs, labs, vital sign measurements, and other
procedures that result in a diagnosis should be reported as an AE to Lilly or its designee.
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to the investigational
product should be reported. Data on fetal outcome and breast-feeding are collected for
 regulatory reporting and drug safety evaluation.
Investigators will be instructed to report to Lilly or its designee their assessment of the potential
relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure and/or investigationa product via the electronic
       case report form (eCRF).
The investigator decides whether he or she interprets the observed AEs as either related to
disease, to the study medication, study procedure, or other concomitant treatment or pathologies.
To assess the relationship of the AE to the investigational product, the following terminologies
         are defined:
 Related: a direct cause and effect relationship between the study treatment and
             the AE is likely.
 Possibly related: a cause and effect relationship between the study treatment and
the AE has not been demonstrated at this time and is not probable, but is also not
                impossible.
 Unrelated: without question, the AE is definitely not associated with the study
                treatment.
As per Lilly's standard operating procedures, all "related" and "possibly related" AEs and SAEs
will be defined as related to the investigational product.
               10.4.2. Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any AE from this study that results in one of the following outcomes:
                 death
      initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization
  a life-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
     persistent or significant disabilitylincapacity
            congenital anomaly/birth defect
   considered significant by the investigator for any other reason
         LY2623091
             I7T-MC-RMAA Protocol                                                Page 29
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the
   outcomes listed in this definition.
Planned surgeries should not be reported as SAEs unless the underlying medical condition has
    worsened during the course of the study.
Study site personnel must alert Lilly or its designee of any SAE within 24 hours of investigator
awareness of the event via a sponsor-approved method. If alerts are issued via telephone they
are to be immediately followed with official notification on study-specific SAE forms. This
24-hour notification requirement refers to the initial SAE information and all follow-up SAE
         information.
Serious AEs occurring up to and including the subject's last study visit wil be collected,
regardless of the investigator's opinion of causation, in the clinical data collection database and
   the pharmacovigilance system at the sponsor.
The investigator does not need to actively monitor subjects for AEs once the trial has ended
unless specified in the protocol. However, if an investigator becomes aware of SAEs occurring
to a subject after the subject's participation in the trial has ended, the investigator should report
them to the sponsor, regardless of the investigator's opinion of causation, and the SAEs will be
 entered in the pharmacovigilance system at the sponsor.
            10.4.2.1. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions
Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed
in the IB and that the investigator identifies as related to investigational product or procedure.
United States 21 CFR 312.32 and European Union Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the
associated detailed guidances or national regulatory requirements in participating countries
require the reporting of SUSARs. Lilly has procedures that will be followed for the recording
and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with global regulations and the associated
        detailed guidances.
               10.4.3. Other Safety Measures
          10.4.3.1. Physical Examination
Physical examinations and routine medical assessments will be conducted as specified in the
Study Schedule and as clinically indicated (Attachment 1).
         10.4.3.2. Vital Signs
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured as specified in the Study Schedule and as
    clinically indicated (Attachment 1).
Blood pressure and pulse rate should be measured after at least 5 minutes supine.
Body temperature will be measured as specified in the Study Schedule and as clinically indicated
         (Attachment 1).
         LY2623091
             I7T-MC-RMAA Protocol                                                Page 30
           10.4.3.3. Body Weight
Body weight will be recorded as specified in the Study Schedule and as clinically indicated
         (Attachment 1).
          10.4.3.4. Electrocardiograms
For each subject, a single 12-lead ECG wil be collected according to the Study Schedule
(Attachment 1). Electrocardiograms must be recorded before collecting any blood for safety or
PK tests. Subjects must be supine for at least 5 minutes before ECG collection and remain
supine but awake during ECG collection. Electrocardiograms may be obtained at additional
times, when deemed clinically necessary. Collection of additional ECGs at a particular time
point is allowed to ensure high quality records. All ECGs recorded should be stored at the
      investigational site.
Electrocardiograms will be interpreted by a qualified physician (the investigator or qualified
designee) at the site as soon after the time of ECG collection as possible, and ideally while the
subject is still present, to determine whether the subject meets entry criteria at the relevant
visit(s) and for immediate subject management, should any clinically relevant findings be
         identified.
If a clinically significant quantitative or qualitative change from baseline is identified after
enrollment, the investigator will assess the subject for symptoms (for example, palpitations, near
syncope, syncope) to determine whether the subject can continue in the study. The investigator
or qualified designee is responsible for determining if any change in subject management is
needed and must document his/her review of the ECG printed at the time of evaluation from at
least 1 ECG from each time point. Any new clinically relevant finding should be reported as an
            AE.
             10.4.4. Safety Monitoring
The Lilly clinical pharmacologist or clinical research physician/scientist will monitor safety data
    throughout the course of the study.
Lilly will review SAEs within time frames mandated by company procedures. The Lilly clinical
pharmacologist or research physician will consult with the functionally independent Global
Patient Safety therapeutic area physician or clinical research scientist when appropriate, and
periodically review trends and laboratory analytes.
               10.4.5. Complaint Handling
Lilly collects product complaints on investigational products and drug delivery systems used in
clinical trials in order to ensure the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and to facilitate
       process and product improvements.
Complaints related to unblinded comparator drugs or concomitant drugs/drug delivery systems
are reported directly to the manufacturers of those drugs/devices in accordance with the package
          insert.
         LY2623091
             I7T-MC-RMAA Protocol                                                Page 31
The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for handling the following aspects of the
product complaint process in accordance with the instructions provided for this study:
 Recording a complete description of the product complaint reported and any associated
   AEs using the study-specific complaint forms provided for this purpose.
Faxing the completed product complaint form within 24 hours to Lilly or its designee.
If the investigator is asked to return the product for investigation, he/she will return a copy of the
    product complaint form with the product.
                     10.5. Appropriateness and Consistency of Measurements
All assessments made in this study are standard, widely used, and generally recognized as
reliable, accurate, and relevant. Analyses for PK will be based on a validated bioanalytical assay
and will use conventional PK analysis methods. The assessment of radioactivity in whole blood,
plasma, urine, feces, and expired air (if applicable) will be performed by well-established
      methods in drug development research.
               10.6. Compliance
Every attempt will be made to select subjects who have the ability to understand and comply
with instructions. Noncompliant subjects may be discontinued from the study. The time and day
of drug administration will be recorded. Drug accountability records will be maintained by the
         study site.
The specifications in this protoco for the timings of safety and PK sampling are given as targets,
to be achieved within reasonable limits. Modifications may be made to the time points based
upon the safety and PK information obtained. The scheduled time points may be subject to
minor alterations; however, the actual time must be correctly recorded in the CRF. The recorded
time of the PK samples will be detailed within the electronic file sent to the Lilly Global
Laboratory System (GLS) and not collected on the CRF, except for unscheduled PK samples.
Any major modifications that might affect the conduct of the study, subject safety and/or data
  integrity wil be detailed in a protocol amendment.

                11.1. Determination of Sample Size
Up to 8 subjects will be enrolled. It is planned that up to 6 subjects will be dosed initially and 2
additional subjects will be dosed if needed, as determined by Lilly, in order that a minimum of
4 subjects complete the study. If emesis occurs within the first 4 hours after dose administration,
            asubject may be replaced. The number of subjects is chosen to provide adequate PK data and
mass balance information while limiting the number of subjects exposed to radiopharmaceuticals
      in non-therapeutic research.
The sample size is customary for 14C-disposition studies. Formal statistical hypothesis testing
will not be performed as part of the primary objective of the study.
              11.2. Data Analysis Plans
               11.2.1. General Considerations
Statistical analysis of this study will be the responsibility of Eli Lilly and Company or designee
Pharmacokinetic analyses will be conducted on the full analysis set. This set includes all data
from all subjects receiving the dose of the investigational product and for whom evaluable PK
data are obtained. Safety analyses will be conducted for all enrolled subjects, whether or not
   they completed all protocol requirements.
Additional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed appropriate. Analyses
will be fully detailed in the statistical analysis plan.
              11.2.2. Study Participant Disposition
All subjects who discontinue from the study will be identified, and the extent of their
participation in the study will be reported. If known, a reason for their discontinuation will be
           given.
              11.2.3. Study Participant Characteristics
The subject's age, sex, weight, height, or other demographic characteristics will be recorded and
may be used in the PK and safety analyses as quantitative or classification variables.
                11.2.4. Pharmacokinetic Analyses
           11.2.4.1. Pharmacokinetic Parameter Estimation
Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates for whole blood and plasma total radioactivity, plasma
LY2623091, and metabolites (if applicable) will be calculated by standard noncompartmental
        methods of analysis.
The primary parameters for analysis will include Cmax, tmax, AUC from time zero to time t,
where t is the last time point with a measurable concentration (AUC[O-tlast]), AUC(0-o0), and
t1/2. Other noncompartmental parameters, such as apparent total body clearance (CL/F) and
         LY2623091
             I7T-MC-RMAA Protocol                                                Page 33
apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase after extra-vascular administration
(Vz/F), may be reported. The blood cell/plasma distribution will be calculated for radiolabeled
material. The percentage of radiolabeled dose excreted in feces and urine will be calculated.
The percentage of radiolabeled dose excreted in breath will also be calculated, if applicable.
        11.2.4.2. Pharmacokinetic Statistical Inference
Descriptive statistics will be calculated for PK parameters but no formal statistical analysis is
          planned.
                  11.2.5. Pharmacodynamic Analyses
          Not applicable
                     11.2.6. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses
         Not applicable.
              11.2.7. Safety Analyses
       11.2.7.1. Clinical Evaluation of Safety
All investigational product and protocol procedure AEs will be listed, and if the frequency of
events allows, safety data will be summarized using descriptive methodology.
The incidence of symptoms will be presented by severity and by association with investigational
product as perceived by the investigator. Symptoms reported to occur prior to enrollment will be
distinguished from those reported as new or increased in severity during the study. Each
symptom will be classified by the most suitable term from the medical regulatory dictionary.
       11.2.7.2. Statistical Evaluation of Safety
Safety parameters that will be assessed include safety lab parameters and vital signs. The
parameters will be listed and summarized using standard descriptive statistics. Additional
analysis will be performed if warranted upon review of the data.
              11.3. Interim Analyses
No interim analyses are planned for this study. If an unplanned interim analysis is deemed
necessary, the Lilly clinical pharmacologist, clinical research physician/investigator, or designee
will consult with the appropriate medical director or designee to determine if it is necessary to
        amend the protocol.

               12.1. Data Quality Assurance
To ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, Lilly or its representatives will do the following:
 provide instructional material to the study sites, as appropriate.
sponsor start-up training to instruct the investigators and study coordinators. This
training will give instruction on the protocol, the completion of the CRFs, and study
                procedures.
        make periodic visits to the study site.
be available for consultation and stay in contact with the study site personnel by mail,
             telephone, and/or fax.
review and evaluate CRF data and/or use standard computer edits to detect errors in data
               collection.
         conduct a quality review of the database.
In addition, Lilly or its representatives will periodically check a sample of the subject data
recorded against source documents at the study site. The study may be audited by Lilly and/or
regulatory agencies at any time. Investigators will be given notice before an audit occurs.
The investigator will keep records of all original source data. This might include laboratory
tests, medical records, and clinical notes. If requested, the investigator will provide the sponsor,
applicable regulatory agencies, and applicable IRBS with direct access to the original source
           documents.
                12.2. Data Capture Systems
                  12.2.1. Source Data and Case Report Form
A source document is the first record of data These can be paper (for example, ECG tracing or
subject diary), a paper CRF on which the data is initially recorded, or data captured directly on
an investigator site electronic system (for example, electronic health record). The site must
retain all source records and must maintain a record of any data where source data are directly
       entered into the paper CRF.
Data may then be entered into either an electronic or paper CRF and the process will be
documented and communicated by the sponsor to the investigator site before first subject visit.
Some investigator site data may be collected directly in the paper CRF whereas other data that is
collected by the site on paper or electronic records may be transferred to the paper CRF.
Lilly does not allow direct source data entry into Lilly computer systems, with the exception of
 the investigator site systems at the Lilly CRU.

For data handled by a data management third-party organization (TPO), CRF data and some or
all data that are related will be managed and stored electronically in the TPO system.
Subsequent to the final database lock, validated data will be transferred to the sponsor.
For data handled internally CRF data and some or all data that are related will be managed by
the sponsor and stored electronically in the sponsor's system.
            12.2.2. Ancillary Data
Bioanalytical data will be stored electronically in the bioanalytical laboratory's database. Data
will subsequently be transferred from the bioanalytical laboratory to the TPO's system.
Data from complaint forms submitted to Lilly will be encoded and stored in the global product
         complaint management system

                                               Considerations
               13.1. Informed Consent
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the subject understands the potential risks and
benefits of participating in the study including answering any questions the subject may have
throughout the study and sharing in a timely manner any new information that may be relevant to
the subject's willingness to continue his participation in the trial.
The ICF will be used to explain the potential risks and benefits of study participation to the
subject in simple terms before the subject is entered into the study, and to document that the
subject is satisfied with his understanding of the potential risks and benefits of participating in
the study and desires to participate in the study.
The investigator is ultimately responsible for ensuring that informed consent is given by each
subject before the study is started. This includes obtaining the appropriate signatures and dates
on the ICF prior to the performance of any protocol procedures and prior to the administration of
     the investigational product.
As used in this protocol, the term "informed consent" includes all consent and assent given by
 subjects or their legal representatives.
              13.2. Ethical Review
Lilly or its representatives must approve all ICFS before they are submitted to the IRB and are
used at investigative sites. All ICFs must be compliant with the ICH guideline on GCP.
The investigator must give assurance that the IRB was properly constituted and convened as
required by ICH guidelines and other applicable laws and regulations.
Documentation of IRB approval of the protocol and the ICF must be provided to Lilly before the
study may begin at the investigative site. The IRB will review the protocol as required.
The study site's IRB should be provided with the following:
 The current IB or package labeling and updates during the course of the study.
                 ICF.

       Notes
Subjects may be discharged from the CRU at any time after a minimum stay of 14 days postdose (Day 15) once at least 90% of the administered radioactivity
(based on the actual dose) has been recovered, or 24-hour urine and fecal samples from 2 consecutive collections have radioactivity levels less than 1.0% of the
total administered radioactivity in urine and feces combined. These discharge procedures are also to be performed for a subject who discontinues the study early.
